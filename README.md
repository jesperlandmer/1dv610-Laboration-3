# How to test?

UC1 - UC4 are testable using the [Automatic Test Application](http://csquiz.lnu.se:25083/index.php).
Make sure you type in the right URL for the application, and type in username and password for an existing user.

Testing instructions for [UC5](https://github.com/jesperlandmer/1dv610-Laboration-3/issues/5) and [UC6](https://github.com/jesperlandmer/1dv610-Laboration-3/issues/6) are defined in the corresponding issues.

# How to install?

First check your PHP version

    php -v
    
The application requires the latest stable PHP version 7.1.6

To install the application on a local server, download any solution stack containing Apache, MySQL and PHP. Pull the repository files, and add them to .htdocs.

To install the application on a public server, I suggest using Digital Ocean. I recommend checking out ["How To Set Up Automatic Deployment with Git with a VPS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-automatic-deployment-with-git-with-a-vps) on Digital Ocean.
